# NixOS-Journey

EN | [中文](./README_CN.md)

[NixOS](https://nixos.org/) is a Linux distribution based on the Nix package
manager, characterized by its declarative configuration and immutability. It
allows you to define the entire system environment, packages, and services
through a single configuration file (such as configuration.nix).

## Introduction

This repository aims to comprehensively document my journey of configuring
NixOS, including downloading software, configuring software, desktop
customization, and other related setups.

## Usage

Directly copying and pasting my configuration is generally not recommended. A
better approach is to browse through each of my commits, review a particular
commit that aligns with your preferences, and then try to replicate my method
to configure NixOS.

I will try to organize each commit as clearly as possible, ensuring that each
commit is valuable and the changes made are not too extensive.

However, I usually write my commits in Chinese, so please use translation tools
if needed.
